✨ I’m a passionate and creative Full-Stack Web Developer, currently focused on mastering the MERN stack.

💻 With a solid foundation in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, I thrive on building scalable and user-centric applications.

🔍 My journey began from a deep love for problem-solving and design, which led me to explore the IT world alongside my medical studies.

🌐 I’ve worked on everything from frontend UI design to backend API integrations and cloud deployment with platforms like GitHub and Vercel.

🤖 I’m also exploring emerging technologies like Agentic AI to stay ahead in the evolving tech landscape.

🚀 My goal is to become a 10x (and eventually 100x) developer who not only writes clean and efficient code but also delivers real-world solutions that make an impact.
